                <p>I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science along with a minor in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego with expected graduation in 2022. I've always been a curious person, with a passion for meeting new people and learning about the world around me. I started learning about computer science the summer before my freshman year of college, and ever since then, I've seized as many opportunities as I can to work with new people and new technologies.</p>

                <p>In my spare time, I'm involved as a technical event lead for ACM at UCSD and as a mentor for multiple student organizations because I'm enthusiastic about getting to know people and supporting them in a way that leaves a positive impact on their lives. I also love, love, love playing the flute in the UCSD Pepband! When I'm not doing things for school, work, or student orgs, I enjoy learning French, playing video games with friends, and watching lots of TV shows and movies.</p>
