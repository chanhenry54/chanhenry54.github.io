        <p>I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego with expected graduation in 2022. I'm interested in pursuing a career in software engineering or game development, but I am highly open to working in different fields and experiencing new technologies.</p>

        <p>Bobabit was developed during SD Hacks 2018 as an arcade game based on catching falling milk tea toppings in a cup. The goal of the game is to catch as many toppings as possible without losing all three lives.</p>
        <div class="fulltext">
          <p>I implemented the player controls and a high score system for the game, which checked if the most recent round's score beat the overall high score. I adjusted the speeds at which the toppings fell and spawned, based on the amount of time the player had survived, in order to add a mechanic of increasing difficulty over time. I also designed most of the game's sprites and assisted in loading the images into the appropriate locations on-screen.</p>
          <p>Technologies used: Python, Pygame library</p>

        <p>Avoid the Bugs! was developed as a final project for the 2018 UCSD Summer Program for Incoming Students. It is a coding-themed arcade jumping game similar to the Google Chrome dinosaur game, where the player must jump over obstacles and last as long as possible.</p>
        <div class="fulltext">
          <p>I worked on increasing the speed and frequency of obstacles as the game progresses so that the player would have a more interesting experience. I also implemented a high score system to give players a goal to overcome. After noticing a frequent issue that involved the player hitting obstacles accidentally, I fine-tuned the responsiveness of the jumping control as well as the size of the obstacles' hitboxes. I also worked on loading the game's images into the game and adjusting their positions on-screen.</p>
