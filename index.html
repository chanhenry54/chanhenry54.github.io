        <p>I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science along with a minor in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego with expected graduation in 2022. I've always been a curious person, with a passion for learning about the world around me. I started learning about computer science the summer before my freshman year of college, and ever since then, I've seized as many opportunities as I can to work with new people and new technologies.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love playing the flute in the UCSD Pepband, learning French, and playing video games with friends. I'm also a mentor for multiple student organizations because as much as I like learning, I'm passionate about meeting new people and supporting them in a way that leaves a positive impact on their lives.</p>

        <h2>Developer Intern, San Diego Supercomputer Center</h2>
        <h3>October 2019 - Present</h3>
        <p>I currently work on the Research Data Services team, where I develop and maintain web tools used by other employees and various research clients. One project I worked on was upgrading a price estimator tool, which involved adding new estimates and the ability to save and load different estimate forms, allowing employees to provide better cost breakdowns to customers. I also enhanced the accessability of an internal workflow management tool by reducing UI clutter, refactoring user data retrieval, and removing an obsolete login system. In my work here, I frequently write unit tests and documentation guides to ensure correct functionality and help future contributors.</p>
