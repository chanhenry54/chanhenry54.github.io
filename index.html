        <p>Hechan Bot is an interactive bot for the popular chat application Discord that serves over 500+ users. It features several text interactions in response to certain messages typed by the user, as well as some commands that allow the user to view various information about their player profile on the popular video game <i>League of Legends</i>.</p>
        <div class="fulltext">
          <p>I originally developed Hechan Bot as a simple bot, using JavaScript and the Discord API, to output text based on certain messages sent by users. Later on, I expanded the bot to request player information and statistics from the video game <i>League of Legends</i> through the Riot Games API and storing it by user through a MongoDB database. Currently, my goals are to implement more features and commands.</p>
          <p>Technologies used: JavaScript, Node.js, Discord API, Riot Games API, MongoDB, Git</p>

        <p>Bobabit was developed during SD Hacks 2018 as an arcade game based on catching falling milk tea toppings in a cup. The goal of the game is to catch as many toppings as possible without losing all three lives.</p>
        <div class="fulltext">
          <p>I implemented the player controls and a high score system for the game, which checked if the most recent round's score beat the overall high score. I adjusted the speeds at which the toppings fell and spawned, based on the amount of time the player had survived, in order to add a mechanic of increasing difficulty over time. I also designed most of the game's sprites and assisted in loading the images into the appropriate locations on-screen.</p>
          <p>Technologies used: Python, Pygame library, Git</p>

        <p>Avoid the Bugs! was developed as a final project for the 2018 UCSD Summer Program for Incoming Students. It is a coding-themed arcade jumping game similar to the Google Chrome dinosaur game, where the player must jump over obstacles and last as long as possible.</p>
        <div class="fulltext">
          <p>I worked on increasing the speed and frequency of obstacles as the game progresses so that the player would have a more interesting experience. I also implemented a high score system to give players a goal to overcome. After noticing a frequent issue that involved the player hitting obstacles accidentally, I fine-tuned the responsiveness of the jumping control as well as the size of the obstacles' hitboxes. I also worked on loading the game's images into the game and adjusting their positions on-screen.</p>
