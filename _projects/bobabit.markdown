### What I did
- Developed arcade game based around catching falling milk tea toppings in a cup as a project submission for SD Hacks 2018
- Configured multiple key game mechanics (player controls, scoring system, object movement) through the use of conditional logic and game states
- Illustrated all in-game sprites and half of the game art
- Oversaw playtesting of the game and quickly resolved game-breaking bugs when they arose

### What I used
Python, Pygame, Git, Heroku
