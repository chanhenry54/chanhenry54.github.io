### What I did

- Implemented the obstacle spawning rate and the obstacle acceleration over time mechanic, while also devising the general structure for the scoring system
- Supervised playtesting of the game and significantly improved game responsiveness to players' movement and object collision

### What I used
Python, Pygame, Git, Heroku
